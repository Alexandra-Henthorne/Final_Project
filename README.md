By looking at the trianing set you can see that the quality and predicted quality amount were coming out the same meaning that the training set was prediciting the quality of the wine . But when looking at the testing set  the quality of the wine and our "predicted quality" were not coming out the same . Most of the predicted quality was either coming out one quality point above or below the actual quality point that was in the dataset we were using. There was however one outlier where the point was three off , a much bgger difference than the others.

These photots  show that we were able to predict the quality of the wine  to the best of our ability. Although the predicted quality point was not coming out in direct correlation to the quality point in the data the fact that it was within one  shows that it was not a total loss or off too much . In my mind that is a success since it was pretty close. 

Since we were also looking at the ingredients and if they played a part in determining the quality of wine there was not one that stood out in direct correlation to the quality. I know this because the values for the wines in each column for the ingredients are scattered. This is why our plots looked messy as well as our bar graphs. This tells me that all the ingredients play a part  in the wine quality because there was not a certain number or amount for one of the ingredients that  was the same in the colum for the high quality of wine.

Since my predicted quality points were close to the quality points in the dataset I think there is something to work with here but maybe with a more in depth coding or plotting.
