# Final_Project

For this segment I have used pandas , matplot, and beautifulsoup, KD Tree and other applications as shown in step one to sort and analyze my data.

I first cleaned the data to make sure there were no errors, missing data or columns that did not benefit the data.

Since the white wine data had far more data than the red I needed to match the data set number and  I neeeded to perform a randomization to make sure that I was not being biased . So I matched the white nd red wine to 1599 .

AFter this one done, data cleaned and the  same amount of infmration for both sets of wine I could begin coding. 

I first made a correlation table to see if any ingredients correlated to the quality of wine. This was not helpful as the data  for the quality of wine was not all the same . Which is what I was hoping but it couldnt be that easy. :) 

I then wanted to make sure since I was just looking at numbers and colums so I created a scatter plot for each ingredient in correltion with quality to see if something stood out .

Nothing was really standing out to me from this correlation.

So then I went on to create a training set  at 80 percent of the total data and 20 percent of the testing.

After this I wanted to see what the training set looked like by not specifying a red or white wine.

It gave me high qaulity wines but the issues was that the qualities all differed. 

Now to the Kd Tree

The reason that I choose to use this is was because I was hoping that it would better show or determine by hypothesis/question.
