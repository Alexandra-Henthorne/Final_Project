# Final_Project

 Selected topic
 * The topic that I choose  was wine. :) Specifically what makes a great wine?
 
Reason why they selected their topic 
* I selected wine because it has always been my drink of choice . Its easy for me and never fails , unlike mixed drinks where I can either get something too strong, too watered down or too sweet. With wine I have realzied it is a safe bet and the best bang for my buck.
