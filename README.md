The Data 

Looking more closely at the data that I choose you will see that there are 12 categories or ingredients I should say that gives a glass of wine its unique taste and likeability .

The data set that I am using is showing data from 1599 red wines and 4898 white wines.

All of these wines were graded on a scale of 0-10, 0 being bad and 10 being excellent. This type of grading wil help us determine if the higher graded wines have similiar ranges in certain ingredients.

The inout varibales, aka the ingredients and categories are below.

   Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1 - fixed acidity
   2 - volatile acidity
   3 - citric acid
   4 - residual sugar
   5 - chlorides
   6 - free sulfur dioxide
   7 - total sulfur dioxide
   8 - density
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates
   11 - alcohol
   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
   
   I also looked up the ingredients so that I could not only understand my data set but also to know what goes into the wine that I am drinking. :) 
   
1 - fixed acidity: Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

2 - volatile acidity: The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

3 - citric acid: Found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines

4 - residual sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it’s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

5 - chlorides: The amount of salt in the wine

6 - free sulfur dioxide: The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

7 - total sulfur dioxide: Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

8 - density: The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

9 - pH: Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

10 - sulphates: A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

11 - alcohol: The percent alcohol content of the wine
